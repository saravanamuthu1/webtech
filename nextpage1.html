        <p class="card-text">Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the general availability of AWS IoT FleetWise, a new service that makes it easier for automotive companies to collect, transform, and transfer vehicle data to the cloud in near real time. Automakers, suppliers, fleet operators, and technology solution vendors in the automotive industry can use AWS IoT FleetWise to collect and organize vehicle data more easily, and to store the data in a standardized way for data analysis in the cloud. AWS IoT FleetWise helps automotive companies efficiently transfer data to the cloud in near real time using the service’s intelligent data-collection capabilities. These capabilities allow developers to reduce the amount of data transferred to the cloud by defining rules for when to collect and transfer it based on configurable parameters (e.g., vehicle temperature, speed, and type). Once the data is in the cloud, automotive companies can use it for applications that analyze vehicle fleet health to more quickly identify potential recalls or safety issues, make in-vehicle infotainment systems smarter, or improve advanced technologies like autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems with analytics and machine learning.</p>
